### Overview

This folder contains an example CloudFormation template that can be used to launch the tCell nginx agent.

The included example demonstrates how to launch and configure the agent for use as a reverse proxy. For production deployments we recommend using the AMI as a reference example or as the basis for your own image. tCell agents are flexible and support a number of other deployments. See https://docs.rapid7.com/tcell/ for more information.

The AMI is built on ubuntu 18.04 and has been made available in the AWS ``us-east-1`` region. Please reach out to your primary Rapid7 contact or Rapid7 support if you have feedback on the AMI or would like to request support for additional builds or regions.
